## TOPress3D: 3D topology optimization with design-dependent pressure loads in MATLAB
`TOPress3D.m` provides a MATLAB implementation for 3D topology optimization of structures subjected to designâ€‘dependent pressure loads. Typically, a design-dependent load changes its direction, location and/or magnitude as topology optimization advances, and, thus, poses several unique challenges.
